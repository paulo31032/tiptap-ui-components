## Installation

To get started, you can install the package via npm or yarn. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install tiptap-ui-components
```

or 

```bash
yarn add tiptap-ui-components
```

## Usage

After installation, you can import the components into your React application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Editor } from 'tiptap-ui-components';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Rich Text Editor</h1>
      <Editor />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This code will render a basic rich text editor. You can further customize it based on your requirements.

## Components

The library includes several components to help you build your editor:

- **Editor**: The main component for the text editor.
- **Toolbar**: A customizable toolbar for formatting options.
- **Menu**: A dropdown menu for additional features.
- **Button**: A reusable button component for toolbar actions.

### Editor

The `Editor` component is the core of your text editing experience. You can customize its behavior and appearance through props.

### Toolbar

The `Toolbar` component provides buttons for common formatting actions like bold, italic, and underline. You can add or remove buttons as needed.

### Menu

The `Menu` component allows for additional features, such as inserting images or links. You can configure the menu to show the options relevant to your application.

### Button

The `Button` component is a simple, reusable button that you can use in your toolbar or anywhere in your application.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the components effectively:

### Basic Editor

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Editor } from 'tiptap-ui-components';

const BasicEditor = () => {
  return <Editor />;
};

export default BasicEditor;
```

### Custom Toolbar

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Editor, Toolbar } from 'tiptap-ui-components';

const CustomToolbarEditor = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Toolbar>
        <Button action="bold">Bold</Button>
        <Button action="italic">Italic</Button>
      </Toolbar>
      <Editor />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomToolbarEditor;
```
